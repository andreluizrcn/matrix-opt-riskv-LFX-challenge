Applicant: Andre Luiz

A program that implements matrix multiplication (A x B = C) for square matrices using naive and cache-aware (e.g., loop tiling/blocking) approaches, measure and print performance for both. (Bonus: Allow the program to run with or without vector instructions via compiler flags).
